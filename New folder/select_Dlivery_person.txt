The process of selecting a delivery person for a specific order in a food delivery platform involves a combination of algorithms, business rules, and system considerations. Here's a general overview of how the selection process might work:

1. **Availability and Proximity:**
   - Identify available delivery persons who are currently online and ready to accept new orders.
   - Consider the proximity of each delivery person to the restaurant from which the order originates.

2. **Order Assignment Algorithm:**
   - Implement an algorithm to determine which delivery person is best suited for the order assignment.
   - Factors to consider in the algorithm may include:
     - Distance and estimated time to reach the restaurant.
     - Delivery person's current workload and availability.
     - Historical data on the delivery person's efficiency and completion time.
     - Any predefined preferences or constraints, such as a maximum number of concurrent orders a delivery person can handle.

3. **Dynamic Routing:**
   - If the food delivery platform utilizes dynamic routing, the selected delivery person may be assigned a route that optimizes the delivery sequence based on the locations of the restaurant and subsequent delivery addresses.

4. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - Provide real-time updates to the delivery person regarding the new assignment, including details about the order, the restaurant, and the delivery address.

5. **Acceptance and Confirmation:**
   - Allow the selected delivery person to accept or decline the assignment based on their availability and willingness to take on the order.
   - If the delivery person declines, the system can automatically consider the next eligible candidate based on the algorithm.

6. **Notification to User:**
   - Once a delivery person accepts the order, notify the user (customer) with details about the assigned delivery person, estimated delivery time, and any relevant tracking information.

7. **User Experience:**
   - Consider the user experience by providing transparency and communication throughout the process. Users may appreciate features like real-time tracking, estimated arrival times, and the ability to contact the delivery person.

8. **Exception Handling:**
   - Implement mechanisms to handle exceptions or unforeseen situations, such as a delivery person becoming unavailable after accepting an order. In such cases, the system may need to reassign the order to an alternate delivery person.

9. **Optimization and Learning:**
   - Continuously optimize the order assignment algorithm based on historical data and user feedback. Machine learning techniques can be applied to improve the efficiency of the delivery person selection process over time.

It's important to note that the specifics of the delivery person selection process can vary between different food delivery platforms, and the implementation may be tailored to the specific business model and operational requirements of each platform.
