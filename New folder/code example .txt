Certainly! Let's integrate the described process into the Django DRF code for selecting a delivery person for a specific order:

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models

class DeliveryPerson(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    availability = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    # Add other fields as needed

class Order(models.Model):
    delivery_address = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    restaurant = models.ForeignKey(Restaurant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    delivery_person = models.ForeignKey(DeliveryPerson, null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    # Add other fields as needed
```

```python
# serializers.py
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import DeliveryPerson, Order

class DeliveryPersonSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = DeliveryPerson
        fields = '__all__'

class OrderSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Order
        fields = '__all__'
```

```python
# views.py
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status
from .models import DeliveryPerson, Order
from .serializers import DeliveryPersonSerializer, OrderSerializer

class OrderAssignmentView(APIView):
    def post(self, request, order_id):
        try:
            order = Order.objects.get(pk=order_id)
            available_delivery_persons = DeliveryPerson.objects.filter(availability=True)

            # Implement your selection logic here (e.g., proximity, workload, etc.)
            selected_delivery_person = self.select_delivery_person(order, available_delivery_persons)

            if selected_delivery_person:
                # Update delivery person's workload or any other relevant fields
                selected_delivery_person.availability = False
                selected_delivery_person.save()

                # Update the order with the assigned delivery person
                order.delivery_person = selected_delivery_person
                order.save()

                # Notify the user and the selected delivery person
                self.notify_user(order, selected_delivery_person)

                # Serialize the assigned delivery person for the response
                serializer = DeliveryPersonSerializer(selected_delivery_person)
                return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
            else:
                return Response({'message': 'No available delivery persons'}, status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)

        except Order.DoesNotExist:
            return Response({'message': 'Order not found'}, status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)

    def select_delivery_person(self, order, available_delivery_persons):
        # Implement your order assignment algorithm here
        # Factors to consider: Distance, workload, historical data, preferences, etc.
        # Return the selected delivery person
        return available_delivery_persons.first()

    def notify_user(self, order, delivery_person):
        # Implement notification logic here
        # Notify the user with details about the assigned delivery person, estimated delivery time, etc.
        pass
```

In the `OrderAssignmentView` class, the `select_delivery_person` method is where you should implement the order assignment algorithm based on the provided factors. Additionally, the `notify_user` method can be expanded to handle the real-time updates and notifications to the user and the selected delivery person.

This code provides a basic structure for incorporating the described process into the Django DRF code for selecting a delivery person for a specific order. Adjust and expand it based on your specific business rules and requirements.
